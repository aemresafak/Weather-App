# Weather-App
My first android project. Created a simple weather app that mainly composes of three features:
- Display current location weather data
- Display currently searched data in a list
- Display details of a list item when clicked on it

Some of the libraries used for this app are Room, Retrofit, Hilt - Dagger, Coroutines, and Glide.

Some of the features in this app:
- Search current location weather using GPS
- Search a location weather using WeatherStack API
- Search based on recently searched cities
- Voice search
- Swipe to delete an item
